This project was a collaboration between myself and three other web developers in my UC Davis Full Stack Web Development program. We all worked together to build a beautiful application that allows users to sign up, log in, and organize "to be completed" tasks. This multi-paged application explains the features available to the user before the user decides to sign up, has a very appealing design, and creates a calming experience for the user when the user may feel stressed by the number of task needing to be completed. 

The technology used to build this application were the following: 
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- API calls.
